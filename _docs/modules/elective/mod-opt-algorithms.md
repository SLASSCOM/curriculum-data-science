# Algorithms - Analysis and Design

This module is based on the following focus areas.
- Analysis and complexity bounds of basic classes of algorithms
- Basic algorithm design methodologies: Brute force, Transform and Conquer, Divide and conquer, and Greedy methods
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking and Branch and Bound methods
- Applications to problems such as sorting and searching, traveling salesperson, knapsack, optimal merge patterns and graph algorithms
- Introduction to the theory of complexity
